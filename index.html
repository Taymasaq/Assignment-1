        <h2>Early Life and Residence</h2>
        <p>
          While Conan Doyle never revealed much about Holmes’s childhood, the detective is famously based at
          <strong>221B Baker Street</strong> in London, <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>. He shares his residence with Dr. John
          Watson, his friend and biographer. Together, they investigate the city’s most complex crimes during
          the late Victorian and Edwardian eras.

          As Holmes says, <q>When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains,
          however improbable, must be the truth.</q>
